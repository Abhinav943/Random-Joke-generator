# 🤠 Chuck Norris Joke Generator

> "Chuck Norris doesn't read code. The code executes itself out of fear."

Welcome to the **Chuck Norris Joke Generator**, a dynamic React application that pulls wisdom (and humor) from the endless void of the Chuck Norris API. It is not merely a text display; it is an interactive experience, complete with atmospheric backgrounds, a spotlight that follows your gaze, and an automated mode for endless entertainment.

## 🌟 Features

* **Dynamic Backgrounds:** The atmosphere shifts with the category—from the digital rain of `dev` to the wild plains of `animal`.
* **The Spotlight Effect:** A radial gradient spotlight tracks your mouse movement across the card, illuminating the humor hidden in the dark.
* **Typewriter Animation:** Jokes are not simply shown; they are typed out in real-time, building suspense for the punchline.
* **Auto-Mode:** Sit back and relax. Toggle `AutoMode` to receive a fresh joke every 5 seconds without lifting a finger.
* **Category Selection:** Choose your flavor of humor from over a dozen categories including `dev`, `science`, `movie`, and `history`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React:** For the component-based architecture and state management.
* **CSS3:** For the `backdrop-filter` glassmorphism, keyframe animations, and the dynamic spotlight effect.
* **Chuck Norris API:** The source of all truth.
